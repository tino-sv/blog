    <h2> My Journey Learning Go: The First Steps into Programming </h2>

    <p> When I decided to learn programming, I was overwhelmed by the choices: Python, JavaScript, C++, and many more.
      After
      some research, I landed on Go (or Golang), a language known for its simplicity and efficiency. Here's what my
      journey looks like so far. </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Why I Chose Go </h2>

    <p>Go appealed to me because:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Simplicity: Its clean syntax makes it approachable for beginners.</li>
      <li> It's fast and powerful, often used for backend development.</li>
      <li> The Go community is welcoming, with lots of resources for learners.</li>
    </ul>
